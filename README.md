# Major Space
A site for Davidson College students to interact with members of their department, and share content such as course reviews, upcoming events, and questions/answers.

## Development

### To run development server
```$ npm run dev```

## Web Scraping
The ```data``` folder contains the files we need for scraping our data from the Davidson.edu[https://davidson.edu] website. Run these on your terminal to see the outputs: ```node data/facultyScraper.js```.


## Integration between Github and Heroku
The master branch on Github is directly linked to the Heroku app, thus any commits pushed to this branch will be automatically sent to Heroku.
